# tsay
Simple speech alert and displaying completion time when a terminal process gets completed for OS X

You don't have to keep hopping back to terminal to check if a long process like `brew install formula` is completed. Simply run:  
`brew install formula && tsay`

And tsay will play a nice speech text and display the completion time of the command appended in the window.
