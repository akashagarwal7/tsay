# tsay
Simple speech alert, UI icon bounce alert and displaying completion time when a terminal process gets completed for OS X

You don't have to keep hopping back to terminal to check if a long process like `brew install formula` is completed. Simply run:  
`brew install formula; tsay`  
`sleep 5; tsay//Switch active window to see the bounce effect`

And tsay will play a nice speech text, bounce the terminal icon in dock and display the completion time of the command appended in the window.
